# Expense-Tracker
Expense Tracker App is a React-based application that helps users manage their expenses and credits. It features dynamic user greetings, a dark/light theme toggle, and saves all transaction data using local storage to ensure persistence across sessions. This project helped me practice React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext.
