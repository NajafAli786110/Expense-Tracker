        <h1>Expense Tracker App</h1>
        <p>
            This project is a fully functional <strong>Expense Tracker App</strong> that allows users to manage their expenses and track their current balance. The app is built with React and uses <strong>localStorage</strong> to persist data, ensuring that user information is retained even after a page refresh. It also features a <strong>dark-light theme toggle</strong> for better user experience and incorporates dynamic user greetings for personalization.
